E-mail bundle
=============

In several projects I've encountered difficulty to use email libraries based on
javax.mail and javax.activation in an OSGi environment. This project builds a
one-stop bundle that contains both these libraries and includes Apache Commons
Email.

Building
--------

The bundle can be built by running `ant` and can be found afterwards in
`net.phedny.emailbundle/generated`.
